# Tweeter Backend

This is a backend for a tweeter

## Description

A simple social networking application, similar to Twitter, and
expose it through a web API. The application supports the scenarios
below.

## POSTMAN

All HTTP requests are saved as a POSTMAN collection.
This collection is stored in 'postman' folder in the root of this project.

It is saved in two formats: v-1 and v-2.

The content of these two files is the same. 
The only difference is a format.
 
I decided to include both formats for the sake of continence.

## Details

- we don't care about registering users: a user is created as soon as they post
  their first message
- we don't care about user authentication
- we don't care about frontend, only backend
- we don't care about storage: storing everything in memory is fine

- run Spring Boot application (call main method from Application.java);
    
##### Run all tests (unit and e2e tests):

  `mvn verify`
  
##### Run only e2e tests from the command line:
